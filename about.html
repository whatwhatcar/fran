        <p>
            Fran's Flowers was founded in 1995 by Francine Miller to share joy,
            beauty, and connection with the Mission District of San Francisco.
            Thirty years later we remain rooted in that vision, brightening lives
            with every bouquet while supporting our community. Ten percent of each
            sale continues to fund efforts to fight homelessness across the Bay
            Area.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for helping us grow kindness one flower at a time.</p>
